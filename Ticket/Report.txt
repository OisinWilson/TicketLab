Small Report for Multi Thread Ticket lab

To address the safty issues accociated with multi threaded programming I used Mutex,
due to it having the Lock and Unlock functions.

The Lock function means that the specified Thread owns the Mutex untill the Unlock function is called, 
this then means while a thread is locked it can run without interuptions from other threads.
